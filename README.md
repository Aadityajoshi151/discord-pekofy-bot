# discord-pekofy-bot

u/pekofy-bot from Reddit, but as a Discord bot.

The only dependency is `discord.py`, install that using `pip`.

Get more info about the Reddit bot here: https://www.reddit.com/user/pekofy_bot/comments/krxxol/pekofy_bot_here_peko/

I might host it on Heroku, I don't know yet.

## Setup
Install `discord.py` using `pip` in a terminal/command prompt.

After that, make a new bot in Discord Developer Portal,

and paste the token into `credentials.py`, replacing `<YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN_HERE>` with your token.

Then, just run `bot.py` with `python` and you're good to go!

## TODO list
- add the rest of random messages
- add rating reactions
- clean up the code in general
