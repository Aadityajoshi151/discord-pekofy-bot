# discord-pekofy-bot

u/pekofy-bot from Reddit, but as a Discord bot.

The only dependency is `discord.py`, install that using `pip`.

Get more info about the Reddit bot here: https://www.reddit.com/user/pekofy_bot/comments/krxxol/pekofy_bot_here_peko/

Add the bot to your server, if you want!

## Setup
Install `discord.py` using `pip` in a terminal/command prompt.

After that, make a new bot in Discord Developer Portal,

and paste the token into `credentials.py`, replacing `<YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN_HERE>` with your token.

Then, just run `bot.py` with `python` and you're good to go!

## "Why can't I add the bot to my server?"
The bot is in the verification process for now. It can't join more than 100 servers if it's not verified.

Sorry about that. You can either wait or host the bot yourself.

## Pull requests
